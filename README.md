# Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree
Learn to design data models, build data warehouses and data lakes, automate data pipelines, and work with massive datasets.

&nbsp;

## Part 1: Data Modeling
Learn to create relational and NoSQL data models to fit the diverse needs of data consumers. Use ETL to build databases in PostgreSQL and Apache Cassandra.
