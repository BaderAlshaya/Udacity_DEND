# Project 1: Data Modeling with Postgres
<br><br>


## Introduction
<br><br>


## Project Description
In this project, we collect the data for user activity from a music streaming app called **Sparkify**. 
<br>We creat a PostgreSQL (relational database) and define **Fact** and **Dimension** tables to store the collected data. 
<br>We also use **ETL Pipeline** to optimize queries and understand what songs users are listening to.
<br><br>

## Run

- Discuss the purpose of this database in the context of the startup, Sparkify, and their analytical goals.
- State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.
- [Optional] Provide example queries and results for song play analysis.
