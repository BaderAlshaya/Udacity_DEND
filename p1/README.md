# Project 1: Data Modeling with Postgres
In this project, we collect data for user activity from a music streaming app called Sparkify. We creat a relational database (PostgreSQL) and define `Fact` and `Dimension` tables to store the collected data. We also use `ETL Pipeline` to optimize queries and understand what songs users are listening to.

- Discuss the purpose of this database in the context of the startup, Sparkify, and their analytical goals.
- State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.
- [Optional] Provide example queries and results for song play analysis.
