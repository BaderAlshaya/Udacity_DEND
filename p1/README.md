# Project 1: Data Modeling with Postgres
In this project, you’ll model user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. You’ll create a relational database and ETL pipeline designed to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to. In PostgreSQL you will also define Fact and Dimension tables and insert data into your new tables.

- Discuss the purpose of this database in the context of the startup, Sparkify, and their analytical goals.
- State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.
- [Optional] Provide example queries and results for song play analysis.
